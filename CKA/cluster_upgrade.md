# upgrade cluster
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/

- from version 1.29 to version 1.30
- using kubeadm
- 2 ubuntu nodes: **controlplane** and **node01**

### add repo
**define k8s version**

edit sources list:
```bash
vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
```
make sure the target version is set, i.e `1.30` in our case:
```
deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb/ /
```
update and check available versions:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-cache madison kubeadm
```
for example:
```
   kubeadm | 1.30.1-1.1 | https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb  Packages
   kubeadm | 1.30.0-1.1 | https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb  Packages
   kubeadm | 1.29.9-1.1 | https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.29/deb  Packages
   kubeadm | 1.29.8-1.1 | https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.29/deb  Packages
```
in this case we want version `1.30.0`, so we'll set it from the list:
```
KUBEADM_VERSION="1.30.0-1.1"
```
### upgrade control plane node
The upgrade procedure on control plane nodes should be executed one node at a time. 

Pick a control plane node that you wish to upgrade first. 

It must have the `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf` file.
```bash
sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm && \
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=$KUBEADM_VERSION && \
sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm
```

Verify that the download works and has the expected version:
```
kubeadm version
```
Verify the upgrade plan:
```
sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
```

it'll show what possible upgrades candidates are, and which components should be manually upgraded:
```
controlplane ~ âžœ  sudo kubeadm upgrade plan

Note: Before you can perform this upgrade, you have to update kubeadm to v1.30.5.

The table below shows the current state of component configs as understood by this version of kubeadm.
Configs that have a "yes" mark in the "MANUAL UPGRADE REQUIRED" column require manual config upgrade or
resetting to kubeadm defaults before a successful upgrade can be performed. The version to manually
upgrade to is denoted in the "PREFERRED VERSION" column.

API GROUP                 CURRENT VERSION   PREFERRED VERSION   MANUAL UPGRADE REQUIRED
kubeproxy.config.k8s.io   v1alpha1          v1alpha1            no
kubelet.config.k8s.io     v1beta1           v1beta1             no

```

**upgrade node:**

run:
```
kubeadm upgrade apply 1.30.0
```
this can take a few minutes. Once the command finishes you should see:
```
[upgrade/successful] SUCCESS! Your cluster was upgraded to "v1.30.0". Enjoy!

[upgrade/kubelet] Now that your control plane is upgraded, please proceed with upgrading your kubelets if you haven't already done so.
```

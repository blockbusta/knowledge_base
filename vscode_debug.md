in **VSCode**, you can run your code and pause execution at a certain point (where you get a response from your server, for example), allowing you to inspect variables, the server response, and the state of your application before continuing. This can be done using **breakpoints** and the **debugging** functionality in VSCode.

Here's how you can set it up:

### Steps to Set Up Debugging in VSCode:

1. **Set Breakpoint in Your Code**:
   - Open your Python file in VSCode.
   - Place a breakpoint at the line where you want to pause execution (for example, right after you receive the server response).
   - To set a breakpoint, click in the left gutter next to the line number where you want the execution to stop. A red dot will appear, indicating the breakpoint.

2. **Configure the Debugger**:
   - Click on the **Run and Debug** icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or press `Ctrl+Shift+D`).
   - Click on **create a launch.json file** if prompted, or click on **Add Configuration** to create or modify your debug configuration.

   Hereâ€™s an example configuration for debugging a Python script:

   ```json
   {
     "version": "0.2.0",
     "configurations": [
       {
         "name": "Python: Current File",
         "type": "python",
         "request": "launch",
         "program": "${file}",
         "console": "integratedTerminal",
         "env": {
           "MY_ENV_VAR": "value"
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   This config tells VSCode to run your Python file (`your_script.py` in this example) with debugging enabled. Replace `your_script.py` with your actual script filename.

3. **Start Debugging**:
   - After configuring your debugging setup, click the green play button in the Run panel or press `F5` to start debugging.
   - The execution will pause at the breakpoint you've set, allowing you to inspect the variables, server response, etc.

4. **Inspect Variables**:
   - Once the execution is paused at the breakpoint, you can inspect variables and expressions in the **Debug** pane in the left sidebar.
   - You can also hover over variables in the editor to see their current values.

5. **Step Through the Code**:
   - You can control the execution from this point using the debugging controls:
     - **Continue (`F5`)**: Proceed to the next breakpoint or end of the program.
     - **Step Over (`F10`)**: Execute the next line of code, but don't step into functions.
     - **Step Into (`F11`)**: Step into the function call on the current line.
     - **Step Out (`Shift+F11`)**: If you're inside a function, step out to the caller.

6. **Inspect Server Response**:
   - While paused, you can also check the server response (e.g., the `response` object) in the **Variables** or **Watch** window in the Debug pane.
   - You can even modify values and re-run parts of the code to simulate different scenarios.

### Example Code with Breakpoint:

```python
import requests

def fetch_data():
    url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1"
    response = requests.get(url)

    # Set a breakpoint here to inspect the response object
    print("Response received: ", response.json())  # Set breakpoint on this line

    # Continue processing after inspecting the response
    # Further logic here...

fetch_data()
```

### Debugging Tips:
- You can also add **watch expressions** in the Debug panel to monitor specific variables (like `response`).
- You can **log to the console** at any point in the code using `print()` to check what is happening.

### Conclusion:
By using breakpoints and the VSCode debugger, you can pause execution after receiving a response from your server, inspect the data, and step through the code to continue your work interactively.
